// tallying
// check if created at + round duration * number of rounds is less than or equal to todays date (bracket end date has passed)
// if so -> tally

//ex: if we are in round two and each round is 2days, if created at was four days ago we need to tally (we are in the fifth day)

// this should in theory ensure we don't tally too many times becasue once we do the number of round we are in increases

// disable vote button

//can we take out total duration?
